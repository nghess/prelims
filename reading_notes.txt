Keekeren_etal_2008:
*lower level areas represent sensory evidence, and upstream regions weigh the evidence*
In direction of motions tasks, sensory evidence is "compared" and a decision is computed upstream, in DLPFC and FEF
There is overlap between decision and motor planning and execution areas
	Superior colliculus, FEF, represent decision variables and also is involved in generating saccades

In humans, DLPFC activity may show a more abstract decision circuit, in which sensory and response modality are variable.
	DLPFC mediates lower-level (sensory cortex) activation in order to better address task demands.

4-part parallel/heterarchical model of perceptual decision making:

                         <---uncertainty (insula, iFG)--->
sensation(visual system) --------------------------------> decision variables (DLPFC)/premotor and motor
                         <---errorcheck (pmPFC)---------->

Control for coherence difficulty when looking at response versus reaction time

stimulus:
sparsify cylinder dots to force head movement as well as gaze shifting?

look at how gaze strategies change as a function of information available at attended 


feature based attention:
attending to a particular feature increases the activation of all neurons that prefer that feature, and dampens the response of those that don't.


hypothesis:
based on feature similarity, if a participant attends to a dot moving in a target direction, chances of a (correct) decision are higher if there are other dots in the FOV

head movement will increase accuracy of responses.
